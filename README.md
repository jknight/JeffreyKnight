## Hi!

My name is Jeffrey Knight and I'm a Software and DevOps Engineer at Dexlabs. 

I spend most of my time over at [Gitlab.com](gitlab.com/jeffrey.knight) contributing to [derivadex.com](derivadex.com/), where we're [building](https://medium.com/derivadex) the next generation crypto currency derivatives exchange.

I'm also a Masters Candidate at the University of Pennsylvania in the [MCIT](https://gradadm.seas.upenn.edu/masters/computer-and-information-technology-mcit-online/) program.

You can also find me from my contact info on github or on [Bret's Vital DevOps channel](https://devops.fan/) on Discord.
